/*
  # Fix alerts table RLS policy for service functions

  1. Problem
    - Alerter function can't insert alerts due to RLS policy restrictions
    - Service role needs INSERT permission on alerts table

  2. Solution
    - Update RLS policy to allow service role to INSERT alerts
    - Ensure alerter function can create alerts properly

  3. Security
    - Maintain read access for authenticated and anonymous users
    - Allow service role full access for alert management
*/

-- Drop existing restrictive policies if they exist

-- Create comprehensive service role policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access on alerts"

  USING (true)

-- Ensure anon role can insert alerts (for webhook-triggered alerts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon insert alerts" ON alerts;
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon insert alerts"
  ON alerts
  FOR INSERT
